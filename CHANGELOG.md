### Bug Fixes

- Fix agent send-keys instructions in workspace manifest

Use Enter instead of C-m and add explicit wrong/right examples
so agents keep the Enter key outside the quoted message string.
- Fix send helper: use literal text (-l) and C-m for reliable submit

The previous helper sent text with `Enter` key name which is unreliable
in TUI apps. Now uses `-l` flag for literal text injection and a separate
`C-m` (carriage return) for submit. Also fixes argument handling to
capture full multi-word messages and updates manifest to direct agents
to always use the helper instead of raw tmux send-keys.
- Fix codex resume: don't pass prompt as argument

codex resume --last doesn't accept inline prompts — the prompt was being
interpreted as a session ID. Now launches codex resume first, then sends
the prompt as user input after a delay. Guards against resume failure by
checking codex is still running before sending.
- Fix review findings: quoting bug, stale docs, test robustness

- send_agent_cmd: use buffer-paste with escaped single quotes to
  prevent prompt quoting breakage (Codex review IMPORTANT #1)
- AGENTS.md: fix stale "worktree default" → local is the default
- README: local sessions now survive reboots, clarify agent resume
- test: remove head-200 brittleness, match "func() {" to skip
  heredoc copies, add sanitize_branch_name and default_session_name
  tests (43 total)
- Move regenerate_manifest above dispatcher so spawn works
- Fix claude nesting detection: use env -u instead of bash-only unset

unset is bash syntax — breaks in fish shell tmux panes. env -u is
POSIX and shell-independent.
- Fix send/spawn Enter delivery: use C-m, increase paste delays

Enter key name can be remapped by tmux; C-m is the raw carriage
return that always works. Increased pre-submit delay to 0.3s for
TUI ingestion, added post-submit delay in send to keep focus while
target processes input.
- Fix spawn: wait for new pane shell init before sending launch command

split-window returns immediately but the shell in the new pane may
not be ready to accept input yet, causing paste-buffer to miss the
target pane.
- Fix send: serialize concurrent sends with flock

Concurrent sends to the same target pane could interleave paste and
C-m steps, causing messages to appear pasted but not submitted.
Add per-target flock serialization keyed by pane ID. Replace EXIT
trap with explicit focus restore to avoid racing with C-m delivery.
- Fix helpers: honor AE_TMUX_SERVER, filter non-agent panes

All session helpers (send, peek, agents, focus) now read tmux_server
from meta and wrap tmux with -L flag when set. Spawn exports
AE_TMUX_SERVER for the child ae process. Agents helper uses pipe
delimiter to correctly skip panes without @ae_agent set.
- Fix retire: validate pane-id belongs to session, prevent cross-session kills

Pane-ID targets now resolve through session pane list instead of
direct tmux access, preventing accidental kills of panes from other
sessions. Also use grep -Fv for fixed-string meta removal and update
manifest docs to show pane-id support.
- Fix integration tests: use ae end -f to skip confirmation prompt

All ae end calls in integration tests now pass -f flag to bypass
the interactive confirmation prompt that was causing 4 test failures.
22/22 integration tests passing.
- Fix resume: restore config, mode, and CWD from session meta

Claude Code's --resume is CWD-scoped — sessions are stored under
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-CWD>/. When ae resumed from a different
directory, both --resume UUID and --continue failed silently, starting
agents fresh instead of resuming conversations.

- Restore CONFIG_FILE and AE_LOCAL_CONFIG from meta before agent
  alias resolution (prevents "agent not defined" on cross-dir resume)
- Restore COPY_MODE from meta when no CLI flag override (prevents
  mode drift between original start and resume)
- Restore WORK_DIR from meta in local mode so tmux panes get the
  correct CWD (the primary fix for Claude Code session lookup)
- Restore ORIGIN_DIR from meta in all modes (worktree cleanup and
  env vars depend on it)
- Fix env -u CLAUDECODE prefix bug in resume fallback chain: was
  using $cmd instead of $launch_cmd, losing the nesting guard
- Fix lint and format: shfmt auto-format, shellcheck clean, add Developer section to README

Apply shfmt canonical formatting (redirect spacing, arithmetic, case alignment).
Fix all shellcheck warnings: suppress false positives (SC2015, SC2001, SC2034),
remove dead code (unused kind/MAIN_TOOL_KIND vars), fix real issues (SC2059 printf
format, SC2004 array index). Add Developer section to README with dev tooling info.

### Documentation

- Add session helpers to README and AGENTS.md

### Other

- Initial commit
- Initial release

tmux-based multi-agent workspace launcher with shared awareness.
Agents discover each other via .ae/workspace.md manifest and
communicate through tmux send-keys/capture-pane.
- Add project docs and improve installer

- AGENTS.md with structure, design decisions, and rules
- CLAUDE.md referencing AGENTS.md
- install script handles ./install, curl|bash, and missing parent dirs
- README install section updated with curl one-liner
- Add badges to README
- Add named sessions, session tagging, and ae list improvements

- ae <name> creates/reattaches named sessions (not just auto-generated)
- Tag sessions with AE_SESSION/AE_DIR env vars for reliable listing
- ae list shows directory column
- ae kill all uses env var tags instead of prefix matching
- Rewrite AGENTS.md to emphasize simplicity philosophy
- Guard against hijacking non-ae tmux sessions

- ae <name> refuses to attach if existing tmux session lacks AE_SESSION tag
- add .gitignore for .ae/ and .local/
- Revise README title and description

Updated project title and description in README.md.
- Isolate workspace manifests per session

Write to .ae/<session>/workspace.md instead of .ae/workspace.md so
multiple sessions from the same directory don't overwrite each other.
Single-quote the initial prompt to prevent shell expansion of session names.
- Add hardlink worktree isolation for all sessions

Every ae session now works on a hardlink copy at ~/.ae/worktrees/<session>/.
Agents work on the copy, push to remote, merge from there.

- Worktrees stored in ~/.ae/worktrees/ (invisible to user)
- Config validated before creating worktree (no orphaned dirs)
- Stale worktrees auto-cleaned on session start
- ae kill removes worktree on cleanup
- ae list shows origin directory
- Set tmux window name to session name
- Add send helper script to fix agents not pressing Enter
- Use absolute path for send helper in manifest
- Add session resume across reboots

Worktrees persist on disk at ~/.ae/worktrees/. Running ae <name> again
after reboot detects the existing worktree and resumes agents with their
previous conversation context (claude --continue, codex resume --last).

- ae list shows running and stopped (resumable) sessions
- ae kill handles stopped sessions (worktree-only cleanup)
- ae kill all cleans both running sessions and stopped worktrees
- Sanitize kill target to prevent path traversal
- Replace hardlink copy with git worktree default and full copy opt-in

cp -al shared inodes so agent edits could corrupt originals. Replace
with git worktree (detached HEAD) as default and cp -a as opt-in via
--full flag. Add session metadata for mode-aware cleanup, MODE column
in ae list, copy mode validation, and improved send helper that
focuses pane before paste+Enter for reliable TUI input.
- Add local mode and rename flags to --worktree/--copy/--local

New --local flag runs agents directly in the current directory
without any copy or worktree. Rename --git to --worktree and
--full to --copy for consistency across three modes. Store
AE_MODE in tmux env so ae list/kill work for local sessions
which have no on-disk worktree directory.
- Single-agent default with on-demand spawn helper

Start with just the main agent, spawn more on demand via
.ae/<session>/spawn <alias> [prompt]. Workers config still
works for fixed layouts but is no longer in the default config.

- rename default aliases to full names (claude/codex/opencode)
- add spawn helper with safe meta parsing and buffer-paste prompt
- regenerate workspace.md from live tmux panes (ae: prefix filter)
- extend meta file with session/work_dir/layout/config/main_pane
- always refresh dynamic meta fields on resume (pane IDs change)
- include spawn instructions in workspace.md and initial prompt
- Replace kill with end (commit+push+cleanup) and discard

ae end: auto-commits dirty state, pushes to ae/<session> branch,
then removes the tmux session and worktree/copy. Preserves session
on commit or push failure. Local mode just kills tmux.

ae discard: destroys session without saving (old kill behavior).
ae kill: deprecated alias to discard with warning.
- Move session state to ~/.ae/sessions/, keep working dirs clean

Session metadata, helpers (send/spawn), and workspace.md now live
in ~/.ae/sessions/<session>/ instead of <workdir>/.ae/<session>/.
Working directories stay clean — no .ae/ pollution, no gitignore
needed. Agents use fully-expanded absolute paths from the manifest.

Backward-compat: read_session_meta falls back to old worktree-nested
path for existing sessions. cleanup_session removes legacy paths.
- Switch default mode from git worktree to local
- Session-scoped agent resume across reboots

Thread a unique UUID per agent pane through the full session lifecycle:
generate on first start, persist in meta, inject into agent CLI flags,
and restore on resume. Claude Code uses --session-id/--resume, Codex
gets post-launch capture with flock-serialized meta writes, unknown
agents fall back to fresh start.

Also: local mode now detects existing sessions for resume, flag
stripping uses whole-token matching, and gen_uuid has no python
fallback (bash/tmux/git only per project rules).
- Add test suite for pure functions

34 assertions covering strip_session_flags, resume_cmd_from_cmd,
inject_session_id, tool_kind_from_cmd, tool_name_from_cmd, and
gen_uuid. Pure bash, no test framework dependency. Extracts functions
from ae via awk and tests them in isolation.
- Harden ae: health check, spawn self-invoke, spawn resume, integration tests

1. ae list shows agent health (alive/total, ! for crashed agents)
2. spawn refactored from declare-f heredoc to ae _spawn self-invocation,
   eliminating function inlining drift risk
3. spawned agents persist in meta and survive reboot with session-scoped
   IDs, flock-serialized writes, and codex capture support
4. 18 integration tests using isolated tmux server (AE_TMUX_SERVER),
   covering lifecycle, resume, health check, spawn persistence, and
   end-session workflows

Also moved resolve_agent_session_id and capture_codex_session_id to
top-level function block for availability across all code paths.
- Sharpen docs: emphasize simplicity, fix stale spawn info

AGENTS.md: add "What ae is NOT" section, line count cap (~1500),
strengthen philosophy ("simplicity is the feature"). README: rewrite
opening to lead with the value prop (one command, everything resumes),
fix stale note about spawned agents being ephemeral (they now persist).
- Add status/end-without-name/project-config, system prompt injection

- ae status [name]: show recent agent output without attaching
- ae end/discard/status auto-detect current session from $TMUX
- per-project config: .ae/config in project dir shadows global
- inject ae workspace context into system prompt (Claude Code
  via --append-system-prompt, Codex via -c developer_instructions)
  so agents retain ae awareness through context compaction
- slim initial prompt (system prompt carries all instructions now)
- move tests to tests/unit and tests/integration
- Add ae stop: pause session for later resume

Kills tmux session but preserves all meta — next ae <name>
resumes with all agents (main, workers, spawned) restored.
- Drop initial prompt on fresh start, system prompt is sufficient

Agents with system prompt injection (claude, codex) start
interactive — no busywork reading workspace.md on first turn.
Resume still sends a short nudge about changed pane IDs.
- Drop resume initial prompt too, system prompt is sufficient
- Name agent panes ae:<alias>:<name> for clearer identification

Main pane: ae:claude:main, workers: ae:codex:worker-0, spawned:
ae:claude:reviewer (user-named) or ae:claude:spawned-0 (auto).
Spawn syntax: spawn <alias>[:<name>] [prompt]. Manifest, meta,
and resume all parse the new format with backward compat for old
sessions. Spawn index scan + auto-naming moved inside flock to
prevent races.
- Agents address each other by name instead of raw pane IDs

Send helper resolves agent names (claude:main, codex:worker-0) to
pane IDs by scanning titles. System prompt and workspace.md tell
agents to use names. Pane border strips ae: prefix for cleaner
tmux display. ae status shows clean names too.
- Config-driven agent names, @ae_agent pane option, encourage creative naming

Config supports alias:name (e.g. main=claude:lead, workers=codex:reviewer).
Default name is the alias itself. Duplicate names auto-deduplicated.

Agent identity stored in tmux pane option @ae_agent — immune to title
overrides by tools like Claude Code. All scanning (manifest, health,
status, send) uses @ae_agent. Border display uses it too.

System prompt and workspace.md encourage descriptive names when spawning
(codex:reviewer, claude:pair-programmer). Auto-fallback: helper-N.
Role labels: lead/agent instead of main/worker/spawned.
- Rewrite README: streamlined, focused on real workflow

Drop verbose sections (modes table, session management list, workspace.md
internals). Lead with why-ae bullet points, show 4 real use cases, keep
config and commands compact. Reflects current state: named agents,
system prompt injection, reboot persistence, clean repos.
- Natural language for collaboration, document copy modes
- Explain how inter-agent communication works under the hood
- Configurable [prompt] instructions injected into agent system prompts
- Opencode support: inject workspace context as emphasized initial message
- Gemini cli support: context injection via -i, resume via --resume latest

Gemini gets workspace context through -i (prompt-interactive) flag.
Resume uses --resume latest (index-based, no UUID scoping).
Gemini-specific strip_gemini_prompt_flags() avoids breaking -i on
non-gemini commands.
- Ae list: show TARGET column for copy/worktree working directories
- Unified agent meta format, per-agent ae list, resilient resume, codex self-registration

- unified meta: agent.SLOT=alias:name:session_id replaces separate spawned.N + agent_session.N entries
- ae list: per-agent rows with truncated session IDs and idle markers, columnar layout with indented target
- resilient resume: claude --resume UUID || --continue fallback, codex resume || fresh start
- codex self-registration: register-sid helper script with slot-scoped sid files (prevents race conditions)
- preserve config flags (e.g. --yolo) through codex resume path
- colon validation: reject agent names containing ':' in main, worker, and spawn paths
- collapse discard/kill into end (ae end|rm is the only exit command)
- AGENTS.md: agent tool capabilities table documenting session/resume/prompt differences
- fix: shell-quote injection in codex developer_instructions when meta_dir contains single quotes
- fix: send_agent_cmd defined before dispatcher so _cmd_spawn can call it
- Ae <name> use <alias> CLI override, drop discard command, update docs

- ae <name> use <alias>: override main agent from CLI without editing config
- remove discard/kill commands — ae end|rm is the only exit path
- update README: document use syntax, replace discard references, fix ae list format
- integration test for use override (pane title + meta assertion)
- Config parser: allow hyphens, fix resume/codex/gemini, ae end safeguard

- parse_config: allow hyphens in section names and keys (gemini-flash etc)
- resume: read agent.main from session meta to preserve 'use' override
- codex: send initial "Go" prompt to trigger developer_instructions
- gemini: add "wait for task" instruction to -i context injection
- ae end: interactive y/N confirmation (single keypress), -f to bypass
- Reply-back communication pattern, fix claude nesting detection

- build_ae_context: teach agents to reply via send instead of polling capture-pane
- workspace.md: document reply-back pattern as primary communication flow
- spawn: resolve caller agent name, include reply-back instruction in spawn prompt
- send_agent_cmd: unset CLAUDECODE env var so claude launches from inside ae sessions
- Resolve bare agent names (e.g. send "lead" instead of "claude:lead")
- Add peek helper, fix local-outside-function bug in send

Add peek session helper: thin wrapper around tmux capture-pane with
agent name resolution. Supports bare names, numeric line count with
clamping (default 80, max 2000). Documented in workspace manifest.

Fix send helper: remove `local` keyword used outside a function in
the name resolution loop (caused errors in bash strict mode).
- Add agents and focus session helpers

agents: list all agents in session with pane ID and process name.
focus: switch to another agent's pane by name, with same name
resolution as send/peek (exact alias:name + bare name fallback).
Both documented in workspace manifest.
- Add retire helper: clean removal of spawned agents

retire kills the pane, removes the agent.spawned entry from meta
(flock-protected), rebalances layout, and regenerates the manifest.
Guards against retiring main or worker agents. Implemented as
ae _retire internal command with thin helper script, matching the
spawn pattern.
- Add interrupt helper: cancel agent generation with optional redirect

Single Escape to interrupt (safe across all TUIs — double-Escape
triggers edit/rewind on Claude, Codex, Gemini). Shares per-target
flock with send to prevent interleaving. Optional message delivered
inline after 0.5s delay. Documented in manifest, README, AGENTS.md.
- Add ask helper, expand agent system prompt with all helpers

The injected system prompt (build_ae_context) only mentioned send and
spawn. Agents didn't know about peek, agents, focus, interrupt, or
retire — limiting their ability to collaborate effectively.

- Expand build_ae_context to list all 8 session helpers with brief
  descriptions
- Add `ask` helper: thin wrapper around send that auto-detects
  caller identity via @ae_agent and embeds reply-to metadata in the
  message, making request-response between agents reliable
- Fall back to plain send if caller identity can't be detected
- Use alias:name (not bare name) in reply-to for unambiguous routing
- Update OpenCode initial prompt to reference helpers generically
- Document ask in AGENTS.md helper table
- Add justfile pipeline, version support, ask helper, expanded agent prompt

- Add justfile with check/lint/test/release pipeline (SemVer, git-cliff
  changelog, shellcheck, shfmt, GitHub releases via gh)
- Add AE_VERSION constant and ae version/--version command
- Add cliff.toml for git-cliff with SemVer tag pattern
- Add ask helper: structured send with reply-to metadata so agents
  reliably respond back to the asking agent
- Expand build_ae_context to list all 8 session helpers (was only
  send + spawn, agents didn't know about peek/agents/focus/interrupt/retire)
- Add version badge to README, document ask helper
- Update AGENTS.md structure section

### Refactoring

- Extract subcommands into named functions
- Refactor helpers into shared _lib, add cross-session communication

Extract duplicated resolver/lock logic from all helpers into _lib shared
library. Add @session:agent syntax for cross-session send/peek/focus/interrupt.
Add agents --all for cross-session discovery. Lock files now use shared
~/.ae/sessions/.locks/ dir for correct cross-session serialization.

Net -42 lines despite new features.
