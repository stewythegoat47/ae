**ae** runs AI coding agents side-by-side in tmux. They know about each other, communicate by name, and survive reboots. One bash script, zero dependencies.

Works with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), or any CLI tool.

## Why ae

- **One command** -- `ae` starts a session, `ae` reattaches. That's the whole workflow.
- **Agents talk to each other** -- each agent gets workspace context injected into its system prompt. They send messages by name, spawn new agents, and coordinate without manual wiring.
- **Everything survives reboots** -- sessions, spawned agents, conversation history. Pick up exactly where you left off.
- **Nothing touches your repo** -- session state lives in `~/.ae/sessions/`. Your working directory stays clean.
- **Single bash script** -- no frameworks, no runtimes, no abstractions. Just bash, tmux, and git.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clemens33/ae/main/install | bash
```

Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clemens33/ae.git ~/.local/share/ae
~/.local/share/ae/install
```

Both methods symlink `ae` to `~/.local/bin/ae`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
ae
```

First run creates `~/.ae/config` with sensible defaults and launches your main agent in tmux. Detach with `Ctrl+b d` -- agents keep running in the background.

## What you can do

**Start a session and let agents collaborate:**
```bash
ae my-feature                  # named session
ae                             # default session (named after directory)
```

**Ask your agent to collaborate:**

Just tell your agent what you need -- it knows how to spawn others and coordinate. For example: *"Get a second agent to review the changes in src/"* or *"Spin up a pair programmer to help refactor auth."* Agents pick descriptive names, show up in adjacent panes, and talk to each other directly.

**Come back after a reboot:**
```bash
ae my-feature                  # all agents resume with their conversation history
```

**Check on agents without attaching:**
```bash
ae status my-feature           # see recent output from all agents
ae list                        # all sessions with per-agent status
```

**Finish up:**
```bash
ae end my-feature              # commit + push to ae/my-feature branch, clean up
ae rm my-experiment            # same as ae end
```

## Session helpers

Inside a session, agents and humans have access to helper scripts in `~/.ae/sessions/<name>/`:

```bash
send <agent> <message>         # send a message to another agent
ask <agent> <question>         # ask another agent (embeds reply-to so they respond back)
peek <agent> [lines]           # view recent output from an agent's pane
agents                         # list all agents with pane IDs
agents --all                   # list agents across all ae sessions
focus <agent>                  # switch tmux focus to an agent's pane
interrupt <agent> [message]    # stop an agent's current work, optionally redirect
spawn <alias:name> [prompt]    # add a new agent to the workspace
retire <agent>                 # remove a spawned agent cleanly
```

Agent names resolve flexibly: `codex:reviewer` (exact), `reviewer` (bare name), or `%42` (pane ID).

**Cross-session communication:** Prefix with `@session:` to reach agents in other ae sessions:

```bash
send @other-feature:claude:lead "check my API changes"
peek @other-feature:reviewer 50
agents --all                   # discover agents across sessions
```

Agents use these automatically when you ask them to collaborate. You can also call them directly from any pane.

## Config

`~/.ae/config` is auto-created on first run. Per-project overrides go in `.ae/config` in your project directory.

```toml
[agents]
claude = "claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --model claude-opus-4-6"
codex = "codex --yolo -m gpt-5.3-codex -c model_reasoning_effort=high"
gemini = "gemini --yolo -m gemini-2.5-pro"
opencode = "opencode -m google/gemini-3-pro-preview"

[workspace]
main = claude:lead
layout = vertical

[prompt]
instructions = "Always write tests. Prefer TypeScript."
```

**`[agents]`** -- register any CLI tool as an agent alias. The value is the shell command to launch it.

**`[workspace]`** -- control the session layout:

| Key       | Description                                          | Default       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `main`    | `alias:name` for the primary agent                   | `claude:lead` |
| `workers` | Comma-separated agents launched at startup           | *(empty)*     |
| `layout`  | `vertical` (side-by-side) or `horizontal` (stacked)  | `vertical`    |
| `copy`    | Working directory mode (see below)                     | `local`       |

Names show in pane borders and are how agents address each other.

**`[prompt]`** -- custom instructions injected into every agent's system prompt alongside the ae workspace context. Per-project `.ae/config` overrides the global one.

**Copy modes** -- how agents access your code:

| Mode | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|------|
| `local` | *(default)* | Agents work directly in your project directory. Simple and fast. |
| `full` | `--copy` | Full copy of the project. Use for complex features where agents need an isolated workspace. |
| `worktree` | `--worktree` | Git worktree. Lightweight branch isolation backed by git. |

**Pre-launch multiple agents:**
```toml
workers = codex:reviewer, opencode:tester
```

## Commands

```
ae [name]              Start or reattach a session
ae [name] use <alias>  Start session with a specific agent as main
ae list                List all sessions with agent health
ae status [name]       Show agent output without attaching
ae stop [name]         Pause session, keep state for later
ae end|rm [name]       Commit, push to ae/<name> branch, clean up
```

When run inside an ae session, `stop`, `end`, and `status` detect the current session automatically.

## How it works

Each agent gets a workspace context injected into its system prompt (Claude Code's `--append-system-prompt`, Codex's `developer_instructions`, Gemini's `-i`). That context tells it who the other agents are, how to reach them by name, and how to spawn or retire agents. The actual communication happens through shell helpers (`send`, `peek`, `spawn`, `retire`, etc.) that ae generates in `~/.ae/sessions/` -- agents call them like any other CLI tool.

No custom protocols, no frameworks. Just system prompts and bash scripts that agents already know how to use.
